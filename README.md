Programming Exercises from "Hello! Python" by Anthony Briggs

Published by Manning Publications Co. in 2012

This book was recommended by Michael Dominick on the first episode of
Coder Radio on Jupiter Broadcasting
<http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/20497/gateways-to-programming-cr-01/>

The book is written to Python 2.X but I have ported all of it to working
Python 3.3 code. His code is all released under the 3-Clause BSD License as is
mine.
